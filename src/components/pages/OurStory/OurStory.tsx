    'those stories. Peter and Angela met on a sunny day in May 2018 at the andagon headquarters in Cologne, Germany. ' +
    '\n \n Peter had originally declined the job offer because he wanted to live and work in Munich which is about 6' +
    ' hours away from Cologne. After numerous persuasion attempts by the tenacious recruiter Julian Sandig, Peter' +
    ' finally caved and accepted. He never knew that that single act would change his life forever.';

    ' a change. She applied for a job as a Team Assistant through a personnel placement agency called adevis. Knowing' +
    ' full well that she would eventually have to move to Cologne, she accepted the temporary position in hopes of a' +
    ' fresh start. \n \n A couple months later, Angela found an amazing 2 bedroom apartment just 10 minutes away' +
    ' from andagon. At the same time, Peter was searching for a "roommate". \n One day at work Peter approached Angela' +
    ' and asked if she was still looking for someone to occupy the second room in the apartment... And she was. \n' +

    'contemplating changing jobs.';
